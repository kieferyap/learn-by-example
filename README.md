# About
- **Status**: I'm still setting up shop at the moment, so while this repository is public, isn't ready just yet.
  - As of the moment, Vue is *almost* done. I just need to do 20-docker, and the README of [19-testing](web-development/front-end/vue-3/19-testing).
  - After that, I'm going to proofread my READMEs and review my code. 
- **Objective**: To share what we know via easy-to-follow tutorials and code examples.
- **Topics**: Anything related to computer science and programming. 
- **Language**: English
