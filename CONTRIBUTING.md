# Instructions
## Step 1. Add a new Topic Issue

  - The sources you'll be using for the topic, if applicable.
## Step 2. Branch out from `main`
- The name of the branch should be `feature/XXX-topic-name`
- `XXX` is the issue number (e.g.: `feature/001-vue-3`)
- `topic-name` should also be the same as the folder name
## Step 3. Add your folders
- Create a new folder (e.g.: "web-development/front-end/vue-3")
- All folder names must be in kebab-case, and in small letters.
- Create subfolders for each sub-topic, each topic prefixed with a number to represent the order of lessons (e.g.: web-development/front-end/vue-3/**01-reactivity-system**)
## Step 4. Commit message format
- Please use the format "#X (Commit message)" (e.g. "#1 Initial commit for vue-3")

## Step 5. Submit your pull request
- Submit a pull request and it'll be reviewed.
- While being reviewed, be prepared to receive constructive criticism.
- Once the review process is completed, it'll be merged to the `main` branch.

# Guidelines
## Education
- Our purpose for contributing is to educate.
- As much as possible, please add as many meaningful comments to your code as much as possible. 
- Try to use meaningful and easy-to-understand variable names as well whenever possible.
## Tutorial
- Please try to add READMEs within folders if applicable
- The READMEs should serve as a guide or tutorial of sorts
- Please use clear, concise and easy-to-understand wording, and avoid jargon whenever possible.
## Constructive Criticisms
- When giving criticisms, please try to make it something concrete, and can be acted upon, instead of something subjective (i.e.: "It might be better to do X instead of Y because of Z1, Z2, and Z3" instead of, "wow this is garbage, no one's gonna understand this lmao")
