# About
## Objective
To learn about Stores (with Pinia)

## Running the Demo
- Navigate to the `15-stores` directory in your command line
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run the front end server
- Run `npx tsx fake-api-server.ts` to run the backend server

# Setup
## Project
These were the commands I ran to start `15-stores`. You don't have to run them anymore, but these commands may be helpful to those who would like to setup a project that has `cookie-es`:

```bash
npm install pinia
```

This project is a continuation of the previous one, so for this project to work, feel free to have a look at [../14-composables/README.md](./../14-composables/README.md) and install the appropriate packages.
