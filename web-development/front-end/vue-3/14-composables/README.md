# About
## Objective
To learn about making HTTP requests with ofetch (and vue-api-query)

## Running the Demo
- Navigate to the `14-composables` directory in your command line
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run the front end server
- Run `npx tsx fake-api-server.ts` to run the backend server

# Setup
## Project
These were the commands I ran to start `14-composables`. You don't have to run them anymore, but these commands may be helpful to those who would like to setup a project that has `cookie-es`:

```bash
npm install cookie-es bcryptjs
```

This project also makes use of the routing and backend communication packages, so if you'd like to install them, feel free to have a look at [../13-routing/README.md](./../13-routing/README.md).
