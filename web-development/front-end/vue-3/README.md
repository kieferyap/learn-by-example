- To learn the ins and outs of Vue

# Usage

2. For first time learners:
- You can go through the lessons/folders in order
- It might be nice to split your screen into two:
    - One to read the lesson's README
    - The other to look at the code
- Vue courses on Udemy are also recommended

3. If you already know your stuff and just would like to review, feel free to look around at the code
